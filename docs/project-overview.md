# Project Overview

FedEReady helps federal employees uncover the true value of their experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Goals

1. **Input Experience** â€“ Let users record past federal job roles in a structured way
2. **Extract Skills** â€“ Use AI to pull out relevant, transferable skills
3. **Match Jobs** â€“ Match their experience to new job descriptions
4. **Empower Users** â€“ Give users ownership over their skill narrative

## ðŸ§© What Problem Does This Solve?

Federal resumes often:
- Use unfamiliar jargon
- Donâ€™t map clearly to private-sector roles
- Miss out on highlighting transferable skills

FedEReady bridges that gap, making skills more visible and reusable.
